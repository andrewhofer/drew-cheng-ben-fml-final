A score of -100 indicates extreme negative sentiment that could potentially have a disastrous impact on Nasdaq and S&P 500 trading value. A score of 0 is neutral, perhaps neither impacting the markets positively or negatively. A score of +100 indicates extreme positive sentiment that could potentially have a highly beneficial impact on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 trading value. Make sure that is the impact on those two indexes as a whole, not the impact on some niche market or micro sectors. If you think that this is not a news article title or will not impact the financial market as a whole, return 0. Please provide only numerical responses, no explanation."
